# HookUI

You want to select the Notifications as the start build order and debug and x64 (or whatever you cpu is) in order to run it.

You can receive any notifications not just the ones the app creates as a template. Try using it with discord or messenger :)

Essentially this app starts a notification listener once the app is open and a notification is received. It then scrapes the data and prints it to console.
It is written in C# and xaml. We had to learn how to make functional UWP applications in order to achieve this. We did use some sample files to get started
but we had to learn how to do this from 0 experience in this environment. 

The app.xaml.cs was the main page where the listener is written.

This app was written by Christian Jackson
and co-written by Victor Pham and Judge Pham.
